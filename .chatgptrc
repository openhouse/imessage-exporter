## Project Philosophy and Guidelines

- **Clarity and Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand by humans and AI alike. Use meaningful variable names, consistent naming conventions, and add comments where necessary.

- **Modularity**: Break down the application into small, manageable modules. Each module should have a single responsibility.

- **Consistency**: Follow established conventions throughout the project. This includes naming conventions, coding style, and project structure.

- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation, both inline and in the project overview, to ensure that any contributor or AI assistant can understand and work on the project effectively.

- **Embrace AI Collaboration**: Recognize that AI assistants like ChatGPT can be valuable collaborators. Provide sufficient context and information to enable them to contribute meaningfully.

- **Security and Privacy**: Be mindful of sensitive data, and ensure that personal information is handled responsibly and securely.

- **Open-mindedness**: Be open to new ideas and approaches. Encourage experimentation and learning.

## Context for AI Assistants

- This project aims to create a tool that allows users to view and export iMessage conversations from their local databases.

- The code should be self-explanatory, with clear comments and documentation to assist AI in understanding the project's intent and functionality.

- AI assistants are encouraged to maintain the project's philosophy in their contributions, focusing on clarity, modularity, and collaboration.
